# N-Brief

Single-page app to compose a neurological discharge letter in German.

## Rationale and description

The hospital physician (HP) writing a discharge letter has to put the most important information about a patient into a concise letter for the general practitioner (GP). Interns and new residents of the neurology department need a discharge letter guidance and some examples they can begin with.

There is a big textarea in the middle. You can insert text into the textarea on the push of a button. You have to read the inserted text carefully and change it so that it becomes a correct real letter.

You have to tell the app whether the patient is male or female. Please press the  correct button on the right upper side of the screen. The texts will be modified accordingly.

An experimental version, N-Brief autocomplete, has word completion in the textarea. Usual words of a neurological report are in an array in the code. They get completed with the ENTER-key and the completion stops with the SPACE-key.  

## Additional material

Under Rechner/Skalen you can find now two medical calculators. I thought we need a quick GFR estimate and a Levodopa equivalent dose calculator. I am not sure if I should make more calculators.
