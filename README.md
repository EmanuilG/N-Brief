# N-Brief

Single-page app to compose a neurological discharge letter in German. 

## Rationale and description

The hospital physician (HP) writing a discharge letter has to put the most important information about a patient into a concise letter for the general practitioner (GP). Interns and new residents of the neurology department need a discharge letter guidance and some examples they can begin with. Some of our colleagues have difficulties with the German language. The N-Brief should be of help. There is a big textarea in the middle. You can insert text into the textarea on the push of a button. You have to read the inserted text carefully and change it so that it becomes a correct real letter. 

## Additional material

Under Rechner/Skalen you can find now two medical calculators. I am not sure if I should make more calculators.
