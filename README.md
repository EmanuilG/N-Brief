# N-Brief

Single-page app to compose a neurological discharge letter in German. 

## Rationale and description

The hospital physician writing a discharge letter has to put the most important information about a patient into a concise letter for the general practitioner. Interns and new residents of the neurology department need a discharge letter guidance and some examples they can begin with.

There is a big textarea in the middle. You can insert text into the textarea on the push of a button. You have to read the inserted text carefully and change it so that it becomes a correct real letter.

You have to tell the app whether the patient is male or female. Please press the  correct button on the right upper side of the screen. The texts will be modified accordingly.

## Additional material

There are other hopefully useful texts, e.g. a neurological consult, an EEG report, etc.

Under Rechner/Skalen you can find four medical calculators, a GFR estimate, a Levodopa equivalent dose calculator, a alcohol-amount-drunk-calculator and a BMI-calculator. 

There is also the markdown editor. It uses the library showdown.js. Many thanks to the developers https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/blob/master/CREDITS.md.
